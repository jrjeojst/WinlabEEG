The focus of this project is to create an open C library for processing EEG data.  We are currently working with the Emotiv EPOC, a commercial EEG device that is marketed as a gaming peripherel.  We have just accessed the raw unencrypted data (thanks to the guide that daeken provided) and are trying to make sense of the data.  

Required Libraries:
libudev
openssl

Note: The program does not discriminate very well between different USB-HID devices right now so if you want to guarantee you're getting the right data then only plug in the Emotiv.
