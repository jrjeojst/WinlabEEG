This focus of this project is to create an open C/C++ library for processing raw EEG data.  Our current testbed is the Emotiv EPOC, which we have cracked (thanks to daeken for his helpful guide) and are currently trying to make sense of.  

Renderer uses the Qt C++ Language extension so make sure you get that first.  Then run the following commands
qmake -project
qmake
Add -ludev and -lcrypto to LIBS in Makefile
make

If Makefile is already there just run make

Required libraries:
Udev
Openssl

People Who's code we borrowed : 
Alan Ott - udev stuff
jrupac - getting openssl to work
